## What the future holds
The goal to opening cultural collections has many diverse paths that depends on the origin of cultural collections, type of media, copyright status and so on. It's important to be respectful, inclusive, and considerate when addressing concerns from GLAMs and the populations such cultural objects come from. The advancement of technology and democratisation of access, while far from being complete, has made possible to be include them as actors and executers as much as possible while providing more and more newer, better and cheaper solutions.

Writing about openness in cultural institutions is a task with no projection of ending. There's always a new aproach, or a new tool, or a methodology you don't know about. Therefore, the following roadmap reflects knowledge that I have acquired during the last seven months working with cultural openness; in particular, with the partnership we developed with Museu do √çndio. **Feel free to add new suggestions and priorities**. üåà No idea on how to do that? Take a look at [our contribution policy](https://github.com/contraexemplo/MakeItOpen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
