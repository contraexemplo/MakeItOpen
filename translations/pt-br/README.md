# Welcome
Hello! üëã If you are looking for some guidance on all the processes behind creating and managing a digital collection, you are in the right place! This repository aims to gather all information about digital cultural preservation, creating an open access guideline that you can copy, replicate, reproduce, discuss, criticize, frame and put on your all, cut in half and glue it together, and/or improve by contributing to it! All content in this repository is made available under the [CC0 license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), therefore, you don't even need to credit me, or notify me if you end up using it (but I strongly encourage you to at least tell me about your experiences, I would love to know more)!

## What is the goal of this project?

Its objective is creating a network of open access enthusiasts to debate, create and enforce open access policies. By documenting experiences with one of Tainacan's main partners, [Museu do √çndio](http://www.museudoindio.gov.br/), in experimenting different approaches to make their collections and knowledge available in both a Tainacan instance of theirs and open knowledge projects such as [Wikimedia's](https://www.wikimedia.org/), I aim to identify common work paths and propose ways to potentialize the sharing of cultural objects with minimal rework utilizing open tools and widely accepted standards.

## Who is behind this project?

I am a junior researcher on collaboration and social management of digital collections and a wikimedian-in-residence based on the  [Laboratory of Participative Public Policies (L3P)](https://www.medialab.ufg.br/n/89336-laboratorio-de-politicas-publicas-participativas), currently associated with [MediaLab/UFG](https://www.medialab.ufg.br/) ‚Äî a laboratory of interactive media from the Federal University of Goi√°s, one of the biggest Brazilian public universities. I am also one of the open leaders participating from Round 6 of [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) as a part of their [Cohort C](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/round-6/projects/projects---cohort-c/).

This project is a complementary initiative to [Tainacan](https://tainacan.org), a public software funded by the [Brazilian Ministry of Culture](http://www.cultura.gov.br/) and the [Brazilian Institute of Museums (IBRAM)](http://www.museus.gov.br/) which strives for helping any person and institution to manage and publish digital collections in a easy way through WordPress and aims to help hundreds of cultural heritage institutions to create a public and open network of interconnected, interoperable cultural collections.
