## Introduction

Hi! This project is a complementary initiative to [Tainacan](https://tainacan.org), a public software funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Culture and the Brazilian Institute of Museums which strives for helping any person and institution to manage and publish digital collections in a easy way through WordPress and aims to help hundreds of Brazilian GLAMs (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) to create a public and open network of interconnected, interoperable cultural collections.

Its objective is creating an open access policy based on the experiences with one of Tainacan's main partners, [Museu do Índio](http://www.museudoindio.gov.br/), in experimenting different approaches to make their collections and knowledge available in both a Tainacan instance of theirs and open knowledge projects such as [Wikimedia's](https://www.wikimedia.org/), identifying common work paths and proposing ways to potentialize the sharing of Brazilian culture with minimal rework utilizing open tools and widely accepted standards.

It is being developed on Round 6 of [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) as a part of their [Cohort C](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/round-6/projects/projects---cohort-c/) by [Anna e só](https://github.com/contraexemplo), one of the researchers of the [Laboratory of Participative Public Policies (L3P)](https://www.medialab.ufg.br/n/89336-laboratorio-de-politicas-publicas-participativas), currently based on [MediaLab/UFG](https://www.medialab.ufg.br/), and their wikimedian-in-residence.
