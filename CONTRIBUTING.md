## Adding and editing content
### What is git and GitHub?
*git* is very popular software that helps developers keep track of the software they are developing. It logs things like which files were changed, which lines, when, and by who. It also makes it possible for people from any location to get involved with the project without making a messâ€”automating the process of comparison between the files that you have and that the other person has, pointing out existing conflicts and giving it the green light to merge if everything is OK.

*GitHub* is a service on the web that makes it possible to host your files, manage them remotely and even use some specific features they created themselves, [like a tool for reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/sagesharp/outreachy/pull/15).
### Requirements
- A laptop or a desktop computer
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
- A text editor
- [Downloading and configuring git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) (follow the instructions under "Setting up Git"). Note that Windows, macOS and Linux have different methods of installationâ€”you should follow the appropriate one for your operational system. But if you find yourself stuck on this step, you can [tweet me](https://twitter.com/contraexemplo), [toot me](https://cybre.space/@Anna) or [email me](mailto:contraexemplo@protonmail.ch) (with the subject "Help me set up git", making sure you tell me which operational system you use).
### Forking this repository
First things first, you will need to make a copy of this repository to your profileâ€”which is what we call "forking". This will clone absolutely every single file available on this repository, along with the history of changes made here.

First, you will need to click on the "Fork" button, that can be found on the top right of the page, along with the "Watch" and "Start" buttons.

GitHub will then show you a cute animation while copying all existing files to your profile...

... and redirect you to your own copy of that repository.

### Editing existing files
When you are just editing existing files, or want to add more files to existing folders, you can do this on GitHub itself.
