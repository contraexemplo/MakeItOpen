## Adding and editing content
### What is git and GitHub?
*git* is very popular software that helps developers keep track of the software they are developing. It logs things like which files were changed, which lines, when, and by who. It also makes it possible for people from any location to get involved with the project without making a messâ€”automating the process of comparison between the files that you have and that the other person has, pointing out existing conflicts and giving it the green light to merge if everything is OK.

*GitHub* is a service on the web that makes it possible to host your files, manage them remotely and even use some specific features they created themselves, [like a tool for reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/sagesharp/outreachy/pull/15).
### Requirements
- A laptop or a desktop computer
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
