You can [tweet me](https://twitter.com/contraexemplo), [toot me](https://cybre.space/@Anna) or [email me](mailto:makeitopen@protonmail.com) (with the subject "Help me contribute on GitHub", making sure you tell me which operational system you use so I can provide you proper instructions and help).

## Fundamental concepts
* A *repository* (or *repo*) is a place you store, archive or collect something. In the case of this one, we are storing content related to digital cultural preservation efforts.

* *git* is very popular software that helps developers keep track of the software they are developing. It logs things like which files were changed, which lines, when, and by who. It also makes it possible for people from any location to get involved with the project without making a mess—automating the process of comparison between the files that you have and that the other person has, pointing out existing conflicts and giving it the green light to merge if everything is OK.

* *GitHub* is a service on the web that makes it possible to host your files, manage them remotely and even use some specific features they created themselves, [like a tool for reviewing pull requests](https://github.com/sagesharp/outreachy/pull/15).

* An *issue* is a thread within the project's GitHub repository focused on debating aspects of it. Repository owners can label them to explictly disclose which subjects they're related to; if they're a duplicate of an older, already opened issue; whether they wish help from others to solve it; or if it's an beginner friendly issue.

* A *pull request* is effectively a proposal of an addition or deletion to the repository. They can be created by the repository owners or external contributors, reviewed by everyone interested in it and then request changes, be approved to be merged or denied. They can also be labeled to facilitate filtering.

## How to contribute

### Working with GitHub and git
#### Requirements
- A laptop or a desktop computer
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
#### If you wish to contribute offline or make further additions to this repository
- A text editor
- [Downloading and configuring git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) (follow the instructions under "Setting up Git"). Note that Windows, macOS and Linux have different methods of installation—you should follow the appropriate one for your operational system.
#### Recommended guides
GitHub provides short and concise guides to learn the GitHub workflow. Access [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) to start reading them! You can also use the [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) to acquire practical experience without leaving GitHub and receiving feedback during all that process.

### Thinking about how you can contribute
Ask yourself the following questions: do you work, directly or indirectly, with cultural preservation? If yes, what do you do? If not, are you just a curious person just excited about it? What kind of skills do you have? Is there something you find fun to do you think you can shape as a contribution to this project?

#### If you are involved in...

* **... cultural heritage initiatives and/or intitutions:** tell us your needs, doubts, concerns and objectives related to digital collections and digital preservation of culture, review the processes and tools described in this repository, and help us establish priorities and more effective policies. Use the [**Enhancement**](https://github.com/contraexemplo/MakeItOpen/labels/enhancement) label to explore this repository under this perspective.

* **... research about cultural preservation and policy making:** send us reports or articles about similar experiences in the country, state, city or environment you are in creating relevant issues, or explore our [**Works**](https://github.com/contraexemplo/MakeItOpen/labels/works) label to check out existing ones. You can also tell us about your own experiences on preservation of culture and policy making or explore existing issues concerning this through our [**Experiences**](https://github.com/contraexemplo/MakeItOpen/labels/experiences) label. Note that the former is focused on works formally published and the latter, on more informal, anedoctal content.

* **... digitization of cultural objects or enrichment and reuse of cultural objects online:** explore our [**Tools**](https://github.com/contraexemplo/MakeItOpen/labels/tools) and [**Workflow**](https://github.com/contraexemplo/MakeItOpen/labels/workflow) labels in our issues and pull requests, or open new ones. You can suggest low cost tools and processes regarding digitization, or describe techniques that produce digital collections of a better quality. Point out which strategies to attract and keep contributors work, or describe better the processes of enrichment and reusing cultural objects, citing solid, realistic possibilities within online and offline communities 

* **... I am involved in software development:* explore our [**Tools**](https://github.com/contraexemplo/MakeItOpen/labels/tools) label in our issues and pull requests, or open new ones. You can, for instance, improve the open tools mentioned in this repository byesting them and making user reports; fixing persistent, annoying bugs; helping implement wanted features; or writing and complementing their documentatiohttps://github.com/contraexemplo/MakeItOpen/labels/translationn.

* *.*None of the above, but...**
  * **... I speak English and other language(s)**: submit a translation of the content of this repository by exploring the [Translation](https://github.com/contraexemplo/MakeItOpen/labels/translation) label. You may also explore our [**Tools**](https://github.com/contraexemplo/MakeItOpen/labels/tools) label, or our own repository, to find which relevant open tools we use to help them to be translated to other languages.

  * **...I am really excited about preservation of culture:** tell us how would an ideal digital collection look like, point out what can be improved in current solutions under the perspective of a user and visitor, or describe which experiences you would like to be made possible with the digitization of objects of culture.
