This project aims to be a complementary project to Tainacan, a public software funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Culture and the Brazilian Institute of Museums in a form of a WordPress plug-in and theme to support the management of digital, collaborative collections. Its objective is creating an open access policy based on the experiences with Museu do Índio in experimenting different approaches to make their collections and knowledge available in both Tainacan and open knowledge projects such as Wikimedia ones, identifying common work paths and proposing ways to potentialize the sharing of Brazilian culture with minimal rework utilizing open tools and widely accepted standards.

# Phase two: Elaborating a flexible, open methodology (October)
