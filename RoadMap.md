## Phase one: Understanding GLAM Wiki projects and Museu do Índio (September-October)
* Research on how GLAM Wiki partnerships were established in Brazil and their chosen workflow
* Preparation of an introductory workshop to present Wikimedia projects to the Museu do Índio team:
  * Definition of scope
  * Role attribution
  * Establishment of a didatic approach
  * Selection of supporting bibliography
  * Production of teaching material
* Evaluation of the results of the first workshop with Museu do Índio

## Phase two: Elaborating a flexible, open methodology (October)
* Elaboration and creation of a proof-of-concept methodology that shall answer the following questions:
  * How can we provide autonomy to indigenous tribes to produce and content about themselves on open projects, especially given that their access to internet is limited and generally from mobile devices?
  * How can we automate the process of uploading media to the Wikimedia Commons and content related to linguistics studies (indigenous languages dictionaries)?
  * Which preventive measures can we take to make sure the longevity of those projects aren't largely affected by the lack of governmental funding?

## Phase three: Testing the chosen strategies and methodology (November)
* Preparatives for the next two workshops with Museu do Índio (first three weeks of November)
* Second workshop with Museu do Índio focusing on Wiktionary collaborations (fourth week of November)
* Third workshop with Museu do Índio with the participation of some Brazilian indigenous tribes (fifth week of November)

## Phase four: Publishing an open access policy (December)
* Documentation, evaluation and report of the experiences from the last two workshops
* Publishing of a CC0 open access policy
